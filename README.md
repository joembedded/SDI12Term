# SDI12Term
 A simple SDI12 Terminal Console for Windows
 
SDI12 is a very simple serial protocol (public domain), used for (slow) meteorological and hydrological sensors since 1988.

Data are transmitted in a human readable format and a lot of sensors exist on the market.
This simple and free tool can communicate with SDI12 sensors, only a RS232-UART (as still present on most PCs) is required,
a connector (called SUB-D9), a cheap Diode (like 1N4148) and a Resistor (in the range 5-15 kOhm).
